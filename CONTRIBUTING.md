# Contributing Guidelines

We love pull requests from everyone! Bug reports are also welcome.

However if you've got a question or would like to start a discussion, please post to the
[community](https://plus.google.com/communities/105515929887248493912).

If you would like to contribute language translations, we prefer if you use our
[Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin-wallet/). Languages will be
synced from there regularly.
